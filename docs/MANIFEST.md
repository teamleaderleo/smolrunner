# Manifest reference

`smolrunner.yml` describes the host and execution boundary SmolRunner should reconcile for one project. It is deliberately not a pipeline language: dependency installation, test commands, build logic, and GitHub workflow triggers remain in the project repository.

## Versioning

The top-level `version` field is required. The current and only accepted value is `1`.

Unknown fields and unknown versions fail closed. Future releases may add a migration command, but they must not silently reinterpret an older or newer document.

## Fields

### `repository`

The GitHub repository in exact `OWNER/REPOSITORY` form.

### `runner`

- `scope`: `repository` or `organization`.
- `user`: dedicated Linux service account, at most 32 characters, using lowercase letters, digits, `_`, and `-`.
- `labels`: one or more project-specific GitHub Actions runner labels. Duplicate labels are rejected.

Organization scope targets the owner component of `repository`. Repository selection and runner-group restrictions will be added with GitHub integration; the v1 plan only records the intended scope.

### `container`

- `image`: local image reference SmolRunner should build or inspect.
- `file`: project-relative Containerfile path. Absolute paths and parent traversal are rejected.

The repository owns the Containerfile. SmolRunner should record the resulting immutable image digest rather than trusting a mutable tag alone.

### `verify`

- `command`: project-relative verification entry point.
- `suites`: stable names mapped to one command argument each.

SmolRunner does not interpret npm, Maven, Python, Convex, Blender, or other project-specific concepts. It invokes the repository-owned entry point inside the disposable execution boundary.

### `limits`

- `memory`: positive integer followed by `KiB`, `MiB`, or `GiB`.
- `cpus`: finite value greater than zero and at most 128.
- `pids`: positive process limit.

These values are desired policy. The current `plan` command does not apply them.

### `trust`

Version one intentionally accepts only:

```yaml
trust:
  forks: deny
  trigger: operator
```

Broader policies require an explicit threat-model change. Public-fork execution and automatic persistent-runner PR execution are not implicit configuration options.

## Example

```yaml
version: 1
repository: example/project

runner:
  scope: repository
  user: project-runner
  labels:
    - project-ci

container:
  image: localhost/project-ci:1
  file: build/ci/Containerfile

verify:
  command: scripts/run-vps-verification.sh
  suites:
    focused: focused
    full: full

limits:
  memory: 2GiB
  cpus: 1.5
  pids: 768

trust:
  forks: deny
  trigger: operator
```

Validate it without changing the host:

```bash
smolrunner plan --file smolrunner.yml
smolrunner --output json plan --file smolrunner.yml
```
